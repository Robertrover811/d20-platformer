# d20-platformer

A small game I am making with [Hack Club's Game Lab.](https://github.com/hackclub/game-lab) It will be played by colliding with D20's and a random number 1-20 will be generated if that number is 11 or higher, your jump will be unaffected but if it is 10 or lower your jump will increase in difficulty. If you make a jump, you will havbe to collide with the D20 on the platform and repeat the process.

## Working

Sprites loading 

platforms bouncing

## Needs to be Implemented

Generation of new platforms

Game Over screen

Dice rolling

(Definetly more but this is all I can remember)


## Broken

D20 sprites slide off the platform and get stuck between the edge and the platform, stopping the platform
